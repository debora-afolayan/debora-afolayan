# **Hi there, I'm Deborah Afolayan 👋**
 
 **Data | Strategy | Operations Analyst**

I am a Data, Strategic, and Operations Analyst passionate about transforming raw data and broken processes into actionable insights and efficient systems.
I specialize in building end-to-end analytical and operational solutions using Power BI, SQL, Excel, and Python, with hands-on experience in data cleaning, modeling, performance analysis, workflow optimization, and insight-driven storytelling for business decisions.

My work spans across logistics, customer service, oil & gas, and healthcare, where I focus on solving real-world business problems—ranging from consumer complaint analytics, operational efficiency monitoring, fraud detection, forecasting, and customer satisfaction insights.
